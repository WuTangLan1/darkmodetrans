**Islam Makhachev (Lightweight, Champion)**  
Known for his world-class sambo and relentless grappling, Makhachev has defended his title multiple times with first-round submissions. His strategic evolution under coach Javier Mendez keeps opponents guessing until it’s too late.  

**Jon Jones (Heavyweight, Champion)**  
After a storied career at light heavyweight, Jones moved to heavyweight in 2023 and immediately cemented his legacy by out-striking former champions with superior reach and fight IQ.  

**Zhang Weili (Women’s Strawweight, Champion)**  
Weili’s explosive striking and cardio have made her fights some of the most viewed in UFC history. Her back-and-forth war with Carla Esparza in late 2024 remains a fan favorite.  

These athletes exemplify the peak of modern MMA: technical skill, conditioning, and storytelling inside the octagon. Keep an eye on them as the UFC tour moves through new arenas and championship cards in 2025.
