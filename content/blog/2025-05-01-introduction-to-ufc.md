The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was founded in 1993 as a no-holds-barred tournament designed to answer the age-old question: which martial art is supreme? In its early days, fighters from disciplines such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, and boxing met in the octagon to prove their style’s effectiveness.  

Over time the UFC introduced weight classes, unified rules, and stringent safety measures, transforming from a spectacle of raw violence into a globally regulated sport. By adopting gloves, timed rounds, and judges’ decisions, the UFC balanced athlete safety with fan excitement, paving the way for mainstream acceptance.  

Today, the UFC is broadcast in over 165 countries, holds events in packed arenas from Las Vegas to Abu Dhabi, and commands pay-per-view audiences in the hundreds of thousands. Its evolution from underground tournament to billion-dollar sports franchise is a testament to the universal appeal of combat sports.
