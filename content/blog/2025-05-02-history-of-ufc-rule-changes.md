In 2000, the UFC codified the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, defining legal and illegal techniques, weight classes, and round durations. Key changes included banning head-butts, groin strikes, and certain throws, while introducing a consistent judging criteria focused on effective striking, grappling, and octagon control.  

Subsequent updates added measures like required medical checks, improved concussion protocols, and standardized equipment inspections. The introduction of women's divisions in 2013 under Ronda Rousey’s reign showcased the sport’s commitment to inclusivity and athletic merit across genders.  

By 2025, the UFC continues to refine rules around doctor stoppages, weight cutting, and fighter licensing, ensuring that athlete welfare remains on par with the high-octane entertainment fans expect.
