      excerpt: 'Discover the origins, growth, and global impact of the Ultimate Fighting Championship since its inception in 1993.',
      body: '<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was founded in 1993 by Art Davie and Rorion Gracie under the Semaphore Entertainment Group banner. The first event, UFC 1, pitted practitioners of different martial arts styles against one another in a tournament to determine the most effective discipline.</p><p>Early events operated without weight classes or time limits, leading to chaotic but captivating contests. In 1997, the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board introduced the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts, banning head-butts, groin strikes, and other dangerous techniques.</p><p>In 2001, brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, along with Dana White, purchased the UFC for $2 million and formed Zuffa LLC. Under their stewardship, the UFC implemented weight divisions, gloves, timed rounds, and judges’ decisions, transforming it into a globally regulated sport.</p><p>By the mid-2000s, pay-per-view buy rates soared, and the UFC launched its first international events. Today the UFC is broadcast in over 170 countries, streams on digital platforms, and commands a billion-dollar annual revenue.</p>'

      excerpt: 'A look at how the UFC’s unified rules evolved to enhance safety, fairness, and global acceptance.',
      body: '<p>In 2000, New Jersey codified the first Unified Rules of MMA: weight classes, five-minute rounds, and a standardized fouls list. This framework was adopted by athletic commissions nationwide.</p><p>Between 2005 and 2010, the UFC introduced mandatory medical screenings, concussion protocols, and improved cage design (the “Octagon”) to enhance fighter safety. Knee strikes to a grounded opponent and soccer kicks remain banned to prevent severe head trauma.</p><p>Judging criteria evolved from “fight to finish” mentality to a point-based system emphasizing effective striking, grappling, and octagon control. In 2013, women’s divisions were sanctioned under the same unified rules, marking a significant milestone in gender inclusivity.</p><p>From 2020 onwards, the UFC has refined ring-walk protocols, weight-cut limits, and fighter licensing, ensuring that athlete welfare matches the sport’s entertainment value.</p>'
